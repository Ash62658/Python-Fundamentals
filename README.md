## CrashCourse CS Learnings (Ep 26â€“30)

- Learned how the internet is made of routers and packets, not just websites.
- Understood the role of HTTP, web servers, and URLs in loading a website.
- Gained basic knowledge of cybersecurity (hashing, encryption, authentication).
- Discovered that the World Wide Web is just one part of the Internet.

Next: Build a simple Python app that mimics a tiny part of this (like a basic web server).

A fully interactive CLI grade calculator that:

- Accepts subject names and marks
- Validates all inputs and ranges
